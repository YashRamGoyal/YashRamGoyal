 My name is Yash Ram Goyal and I'm an IT enthusiast currently learning UI/UX design and web development. I hold a university degree from Ranchi and have been actively expanding my knowledge in the field of web development.

I have experience in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQLi, and many more libraries and frameworks. Currently, I am focusing on learning React JS to improve my skills further.

In terms of design, I have worked with various tools such as Figma, Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Canva, and many more to create visually appealing designs.

My preferred code editor is Visual Studio Code. You can find some of my projects on this Github account, which I have created to improve my skills and showcase my work. Feel free to explore and leave feedback.
